## Data description ----

# Acquiring data by merchant type and location includes payment transactions of debit cards, 
# credit cards and mobile payments at merchants in Switzerland
# Data Provider: Worldline
# Period / Frequency: Daily from 2019-01-01

### Variables ----

# - Date: Date of transaction

# - Cardholder origin: 
#   - Domestic: Cards issued to Swiss residents
#   - Foreign: Cards issued to foreign residents

# - Cardholder origin detail: 
# - CHE, AUT, CHN, DEU, FRA, GBR, ITA, LIE, NLD, RUS, USA, RoW

# - Merchant category: 
#   - Retail: Food, beverage, tobacco
#   - Retail: Other goods
#   - Accommodation
#   - Entertainment and sports
#   - Food and Beverage services
#   - Human health services
#   - Other
#   - Personal services
#   - Professional services
#   - Retail: Fuel stations
#   - Transport services

#   Merchant Categories are defined according to the standard NOGA industry code classification. (See https://www.kubb-tool.bfs.admin.ch/en)
#   To preserve anonymity of the data we hereby cluster NOGA codes to summary categories.

# - Channel:
#   - E-comm: Transactions in e-commerce
#   - POS: Transactions at point-of-sale (POS), i.e., directly in shop
#   - All: Transactions in e-commerce and at point-of-sale (POS)

# - Payment method:
#   - Credit: Transactions with credit cards
#   - Debit: Transactions with debit cards
#   - Mobile: Mobile payments include payments executed by a mobile device and debited directly to the consumers bank account 
#     (e.g., TWINT, Alipay, WeChat Pay). They do not include payments executed by a mobile device which are debited via a credit 
#    or debit card (Google Pay, Samsung Pay, Apple Pay)‚Äù

# NOTE: Due to challenges with the classification of transactions as debit or credit-card transactions, 
# we advise to work only with the series of consolidated debit and credit card transactions.

# - Agglomeration type:
#   - 9999: Transactions in the Principality of Liechtenstein and Campione d'Italia
#   - Commuting zone
#   - Municipality: core
#   - Municipality: multiorientated
#   - Municipality: rural
#   - Principle core: city
#   - Principle core: other
#   - Secondary core

#   (See: https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/grundlagen/raumgliederungen.assetdetail.349566.html)


# - Region:
#   - 9999: Transactions in the Principality of Liechtenstein and Campione d'Italia
#   - Central: LU, OW, NW, SZ, UR, ZG
#   - Eastern. AI, AR, GL, GR, SG, SH, TG
#   - Espace Mittelland: BE, FR, JU, NE, SO
#   - Lake Geneva: GE, VD, VS
#   - Northwestern: AG, BL, BS
#   - Ticino: TI
#   - Zurich: ZH

# - Canton: AG, AI, AR, BE, BL, BS, FR, GE, GL, GR, JU, LU, NE, NW, OW, UR, SG, SH, SO, SZ, TG, TI, VD, VS, ZG, ZH, 9999

#   The raw data includes an identifier for the municipality (PLZ) in which a merchant is located.
#   To preserve anonymity of the data we the location of Merchants by two separate methods:
#   1) We classify merchants by Canton / Grossregion which corresponds to the standard international NUTS-2/ NUTS-3 regional classification.
#   2) We classify merchant location by agglomeration type according to SFSO.
#   (See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NUTS_statistical_regions_of_Switzerland)

# The mapping from NOGA codes to summary merchant categories and 
# the mapping of PLZ to Grossregion / Canton and Agglomeration type are available at:
# https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/yLISs3KVE7ASE68?path=%2F4_MAPPING%20FILES


# - Scaled Value: Scaled transaction amount of a specific category/region on a given day
# - Scaled Number of Transactions: Scaled number of transactions reported on a given day

# To scale the data, we use the average daily turnover (in CHF or #TRX) with all means of payment methods 
# (incl. ATM withdrawals) in January 2020. 
# All data points are divided by the same number (CHF or #TRX). 
# The data thus still provide information on the **relative importance** of turnover 
# in different regions / merchant categories / agglomeration types.
